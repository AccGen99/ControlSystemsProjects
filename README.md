# Control Systems Projects
This repository contains the projects in Control Systems Engineering that were/are/will be undertaken by me apart from what is taught in the curriculum. The projects are modeled and parameterized in MATLAB-Simulink-Simsccape environment.

The brief description of each project is as follows - 
### **1. Inverted Pendulum**
A system which has it's centre of mass above it's pivot point. The mass may be distributed in the form of 
1. A linear/nonlinear mass dendity rod
2. Concentrated in a solid shape and attached at the end of light rod

The controller will aim to stabilise the above system.
